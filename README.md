# PLP_Design_Portal
This repository contains a package designed for the creation of padlock probes that directly target RNA molecules. Padlock probes are highly specific molecular tools used in various applications, including RNA detection, spatial transcriptomics, and single-cell RNA sequencing. This package facilitates the design of these probes by targeting specific RNA sequences, enabling precise hybridization for downstream applications.  

In addition to probe design, this repository also serves as a platform for the development of a portal aimed at simplifying and enhancing the workflow for researchers. The portal will provide a user-friendly interface to streamline the design.
